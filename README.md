# predicitive-model-wine

This File is only for educational purposes. It was a project for our 3k mod in NUS. To create a business application that could help in predictiive analytics.
In this work, a Wine dataset which consists of a collection of red wine data is used for all the machine learning experiments (Cortez et al., 2009).

Inspiration from : https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/05/build-deploy-machine-learning-web-app.html to create an application.
